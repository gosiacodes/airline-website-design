 A commitment to sustainability
 </h1>
 <p>Sustainability and eco-efficiency are the cornerstones of all GAAP Airlines Group operations – both in the air, and on the ground.

Our customers, staff and regulators are increasingly conscious about the environment and greenhouse gas emissions.
GAAP Team has committed to environmentally-responsible operations through the GAAP's Group’s Environmental Policy,
which is communicated internally and externally to staff, customers and all stakeholders. For more information,
you can read the GAAP's Group's Environmental Policy.

The GAAP Group’s commitment to sustainability means multi-billion dollar investments in the most modern,
eco-efficient technology available – in aircraft, engines and ground equipment, and by operating our assets
in the most environmentally-responsible manner. We strive to be leaders in environmental performance in our
industry and in our region, and we’re committed to complying with all applicable environmental regulations and standards</p>

<h1 class="f155">Reducing emissions</h1>
<p>
We’re part of a global industry that’s committed to reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

Aviation is one of the most important contributors to global economic and social development – particularly in the developing world.
The aviation industry supports nearly 63 million people worldwide and contributes USD 2.7 trillion per annum to world GDP.
You can read more in the Aviation Benefits Beyond Borders report, written in July 2016.

The aviation industry recognises that, although it’s responsible for less than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions from human activity,
it must be committed to growing sustainably and reducing growth of its emissions. We firmly support the four-pillar strategy to reduce emissions
developed by our industry body – the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Read more about this strategy at www.enviro.aero

We implement this strategy by employing advanced technology throughout our group, including in aircraft and engines; 
encouraging governments to make air navigation more fuel- and emission-friendly; reducing the environmental impact of 
our ground operations; and supporting the development of a global sectoral approach to carbon emissions through the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations agency for international civil aviation.
